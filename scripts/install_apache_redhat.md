# Installing Apache on Red Hat Enterprise Linux

This guide provides instructions for installing and enabling the Apache HTTP server (`httpd`) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

## Step 1: Verify if Apache is Installed

First, check if the Apache HTTP server is already installed on your system:

```sh
httpd -v
```

If Apache is not installed, you will receive a "command not found" message. Proceed to the next step to install it.

## Step 2: Install the `httpd` Package

If the `httpd` package is available but not installed, use the following command to install it:

```sh
sudo yum install httpd
```

## Step 3: Enable and Start the `httpd` Service

After installing the `httpd` package, enable and start the `httpd` service with the following commands:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

## Step 4: Verify the `httpd` Service

To ensure the `httpd` service is running, you can check its status:

```sh
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

If the service is running, you should see output indicating that `httpd` is active and running.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors during installation or while starting the service, please share the error messages for further troubleshooting. Common issues might include:

- **Missing Dependencies:** Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed.
- **Firewall Settings:** Ensure that the firewall allows traffic on HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) if you plan to use SSL.

For additional support, consult the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation or reach out to your system administrator.
